          A multifaceted professional with a diverse skill set that encompasses
          web development, e-commerce, graphic design, and customer service.
          With experience in both technical and client-facing roles, I adopt a
          comprehensive approach to every project I engage in. I excel in
          WordPress web development, social media management, and crafting
          captivating visual content using tools like Canva and CapCut. My
          technical proficiency includes building modern web applications with
          Next.js, where I creatively apply custom CSS for styling, allowing for
          flexibility and innovation in design. In addition to my development
          skills, I possess a solid background in customer service from my
          tenure at HBL and my role as a Customer Service Agent. My practical
          experience in managing online stores has enhanced my ability to
          understand user needs and ensure a smooth online experience. At
          present, I am actively broadening my expertise by delving into
          Generative AI and Data Science. I am concentrating on data analysis,
          data wrangling, and visualization using tools such as Pandas, NumPy,
          Matplotlib, and Seaborn. I am driven to extract actionable insights
          from data to optimize processes and enhance decision-making. Fueled by
          curiosity and a commitment to continuous learning, I consistently seek
          out new challengesâ€”whether that involves mastering advanced web
          technologies, improving customer experiences, or exploring innovative
          applications of AI and data science. I invite you to explore my
          portfolio, where you can see how I integrate creativity, technology,
          and data-driven insights to deliver effective and forward-thinking
          solutions
